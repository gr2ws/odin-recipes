# Odin Project: Recipes

The very first project in the TOP Curriculum. It involves making a basic html website displaying a home page with links to the recipe pages. Mine includes basic CSS. 

There are probably too many commits in this repository, since I've been using this to practice CSS and some Git. Unless I find some mistake this is most likely finished.
