<h1> Butter Chicken </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

    <p> Butter chicken is an Indian dish consisting of pieces of boneless chicken covered in an extremely delicious sauce/gravy, topped with cream and herbs and served with rice. </p>

    <p> A traditional Butter Chicken recipe uses boneless chicken breast, but mine uses two whole bone-in chicken breasts/legs. These combined with the sauce will result in one serving enough for two people. </p>

<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<ul> 
    <li> One Onion (Peeled, halved, thinly sliced) </li>
    <li> One Tomato (Halved and thinly sliced) </li>
    <li> Two Whole Bone-in Chicken Breast/Legs (Skin Optional) </li>
    <li> 100 mL of All-purpose Cream (Don't substitute with Coconut Cream, dish will be too oily) </li>
    <li> Two tablespoons of Butter </li>
    <li> One cube of Chicken Bouillon (Knorr) </li>
    <li> A teaspoon of Ginger Garlic Paste (Sham) </li>
    <li> Half a teaspoon of Garram Masala  </li>
    <li> Two heaping teaspoons of Brilliant Red Chili Powder (Kashmirilal) </li>
    <li> A heaping teaspoon of Butter Chicken Masala (Sham) </li>
    <li> A dash of Turmeric (Just a little bit for vibrance) </li>
    <li> Salt and MSG </li>
    <li> One stick of whole Cinnamon </li>
    <li> Two Bay Leaves </li>
    <li> One Star Anise </li>
    <li> About 50g of Cashew Nuts/Peanuts </li>
    <li> Two/Three drops of Red Food Coloring (Optional, if you want a red sauce, unlike the brilliant orange in the picture above) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Steps </h2>

<ol>
    <li> Marinate chicken in something acidic like lemon juice, with one teaspoon of red chili powder, sprinkle with a little bit of salt and MSG. Keep in mind that the bouillon cube is already salty, so be careful to not add too much salt. Too much MSG is fine. </li>

    <li> Gather and ready ingredients. 
        <ul>
        <li> In one small bowl, place the cinnamon, bay leaves, star anise, onion and, tomatoes. </li>
        <li> In a small cup, place all the spices, along with the ginger garlic paste. </li>
        <li> Ready an empty plate for the cooked chicken. </li>
        </ul> </li>

    <li> Cook the chicken in a deep pot. Use any kind of oil, only a tablespoon. Put the cooked chicken in the plate mentioned before.
        <ul>
            <li> Use medium heat for breast meat, just to sear it a bit. </li>
            <li> Use low heat for a whole leg, and cook covered until thoroughly cooked. </li>
        </ul> </li>

    <li> Clean the pot if there is charring in the bottom. Dump out any liquid inside. If there isn't any charring, continue to next step. </li>

    <li> Place a little bit of butter and heat the pot. Dump in all the contents of the small bowl. Cook uncovered in low heat until onions are translucent and slightly browned. Thoroughly fondle with a spatula ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) so nothing burns. </li>
                
    <li> Deglaze with half a cup of water and place the bouillon cube. Wait until cube is dissolved and dump in the cream and spices. Save a little bit of cream for presentation. 
    <br> 
    <strong>Very Important.</strong> Make sure you don't forget the red chili powder. Without it the sauce will look like creamy and delicious <strong><em>diarrhea.</em></strong> </li>

    <li> Let it boil for a while on medium-low heat. Once the sauce changes color to a slight red-orange, turn off heat and remove the star anise, cinnamon sticks, and bay leaves. </li>
                
    <li> Dump contents of the pot into a blender, along with all of the nuts. Blend thoroughly. </li>
                
    <li> Place a strainer over the pot and strain the contents of the blender. Don't dump it in all at once. Scrape the bottom of the strainer gently to allow the sauce to flow. </li>
    
    <li> Dump the chicken into the pot and heat on medium-low until the sauce turns into a vibrant red-orange. Taste the sauce and add red chili powder or salt to taste. To make the sauce truly red, put in a few drops of red food coloring, but it is not required. </li>
    
    <li> Serve. Slowly pour in the remaining cream for style. Sprinkle with whatever herbs you have, ideally basil. You can also use spring onions. Enjoy! </li>
