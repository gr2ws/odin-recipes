            <p>
                These recipes are modified, by me, from recipes that I could find online. They are in no way authentic to Indian Cuisine. I make do with what I can buy at the local market, and I order only the spices online. I would say these are not for absolute beginner cooks, I usually cook by feel and using my eyes. I also didn't get these right the first time I tried them, so I don't expect you to get it the first time too. Last disclaimer, if you live in a more developed country, these recipes probably won't be for you. I use the bare minimum amount and types of ingredients because I live in the Rural Philippines.
