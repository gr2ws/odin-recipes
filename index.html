    <h2> Hello! </h2>

    <p>
    Welcome to my recipes page! The recipes here are ones that I've found online, memorized, and modified. As such, they are most probably, in no way, shape, or form, authentic to their original counterparts. </p>

    <p>
    I don't have access to a wide variety of ingredients as I live in a rural area, so the modifications made to these recipes are specific to my own situation and may not apply to yours. It doesn't mean they aren't delicious though! </p>

    <p>
    A quick disclaimer, the steps in my recipes aren't exactly specific, since I memorize these recipes. I state what you should look out for and what you should do afterwards. I believe this is good practice as it allows a person to be a better cook, enabling them to improvise recipes rather than follow a specific one. </p>
